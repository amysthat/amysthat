## Hi there 👋

Fancy seeing you here. I'm amysthat. I'm a wannabe gamedev, and I use the Unity game engine. You will usually find my projects being written in C#, as it is the language I'm most familiar with.

Don't mind my name, it frequently changes.

 - 🔭 I'm currently learning Unity's insides, namely the editor.
 - 💾 However I'm also interesting in operating systems, how they work etc.
 - 💻 I sometimes work on my own OS powered by [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos).
 - And a building to more!
