## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Fancy seeing you here. I'm amysthat. I'm a wannabe game developer, and I use the Unity game engine. You will usually find my projects written in C# since it's the language I'm most familiar with.

Don't mind my name, it frequently changes.

 - ðŸ”­ I'm currently learning Unity's insides, particularly the editor.
 - ðŸ’¾ However, I'm also interested in operating systems and how they work, etc.
 - ðŸ’» I sometimes work on my own OS powered by [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos).
 - And a building to more!
